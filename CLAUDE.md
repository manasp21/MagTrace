## Project Overview
MagTrace is a streamlined machine learning platform designed for magnetic field data analysis. It provides a clean, professional workflow for loading data, creating labels, and training models for anomaly detection and pattern recognition.

## Current Status: Renaming Complete, Jekyll Fixed ✅
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-17
**Status**: All components functional, renaming from "MagTrace Pro" to "MagTrace" complete, GitHub Pages issues resolved

## Core Features (All Working)
- **Simple Workflow**: Load data → Select ranges → Label → Train → Predict
- **Fast Performance**: Optimized for speed and responsiveness with data decimation
- **Interactive Labeling**: Brush selection on charts with instant labeling capability
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Rapid labeling with hotkeys (1-5)
- **Professional UI**: Clean interface without emojis or clutter
- **Working ML Training**: Reliable scikit-learn based training system
- **Real-time Progress**: Live training monitoring with progress bars

## Technology Stack (Simplified & Working)
- **Backend**: Django 4.2 + Django REST Framework
- **Database**: SQLite for local data storage with working schema
- **Frontend**: HTML5 + JavaScript + D3.js for interactive charts
- **ML Framework**: scikit-learn (primary) with TensorFlow fallback
- **Interface**: Streamlined, professional UI design
- **Performance**: Optimized with data decimation for large datasets
- **Data Format**: CSV files with magnetic field measurements

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Simplified Training System
- **Decision**: Use scikit-learn Random Forest instead of complex TensorFlow
- **Reason**: Training was failing consistently with TensorFlow setup
- **Result**: Fast, reliable training that actually works
- **Files**: `simple_training_service.py`, updated `views.py`

### UI Simplification  
- **Decision**: Remove complex features and focus on core workflow
- **Reason**: User feedback about UI being "cluttered" and "unprofessional"
- **Result**: Clean, professional interface maintaining all essential functionality
- **Files**: `magtrace_pro.html` (simplified)

### Performance Optimization
- **Decision**: Add data decimation for large datasets
- **Reason**: UI was slow with large magnetic field datasets
- **Result**: Responsive visualization even with 50,000+ data points
- **Files**: `magtrace-pro.js` (processData method)

## Work Remaining 📋

### 1. CRITICAL: End-to-End Testing (High Priority) ⚠️
**Status**: REQUIRED - Implementation complete but not tested
- ❗ **Test complete workflow**: Upload CSV → Load data → Select ranges → Label → Train model  
- ❗ **Verify annotation system**: Brush selection, quick labeling, API integration
- ❗ **Test training system**: simple_training_service.py functionality
- ❗ **Validate UI interactions**: All buttons, modals, and workflows
- ❗ **Performance testing**: Large dataset handling and decimation

### 2. Error Handling Improvements (Medium Priority)
- Enhanced error messages for failed operations
- Better validation for CSV file formats
- Graceful handling of network/API failures
- User-friendly error notifications

### 3. Model Prediction Workflow (Medium Priority)
- Add prediction capabilities for trained models
- Interface for applying models to new datasets
- Confidence score display for predictions
- Model comparison tools

### 4. Advanced Features (Low Priority - if needed)
- Model export/import functionality
- Batch processing for multiple files
- Advanced visualization options
- Model performance analytics

## Key Lessons Learned & Blunders 📝

### Major Mistakes Made
1. **Virtual Environment in Git**: The biggest blunder was having `backend/venv/` tracked in Git
   - **Problem**: Python virtual environments contain symlinks that break Jekyll builds
   - **Symptom**: `error: open("backend/venv/bin/python"): Invalid argument`
   - **Resolution**: Completely removed from Git, added to `.gitignore`

2. **Missing Jekyll Configuration**: Initially no `_config.yml` for GitHub Pages
   - **Problem**: Jekyll tried to process entire repository including Python backend
   - **Symptom**: Jekyll build failures with pathutil symlink errors
   - **Resolution**: Created comprehensive Jekyll configuration excluding backend

3. **Incomplete Renaming**: Initially missed JavaScript class name consistency
   - **Problem**: Had `MagTracePro` class but `magtrace.js` filename
   - **Symptom**: Naming inconsistency throughout codebase
   - **Resolution**: Systematic renaming of all references

### Technical Challenges Overcome
1. **File Renaming at Scale**: Successfully renamed 65+ files and updated all references
2. **Template Dependencies**: Updated Django template references without breaking functionality
3. **Documentation Regeneration**: Rebuilt all Sphinx documentation with correct naming
4. **Git Cleanup**: Safely removed problematic files from version control

### Process Improvements Identified
1. **Always check `.gitignore`**: Virtual environments should never be tracked
2. **Jekyll configuration first**: Set up GitHub Pages config before pushing docs
3. **Systematic verification**: Test functionality after major renaming operations
4. **Documentation consistency**: Ensure all generated docs reflect current naming

## Development Environment Notes
- **Virtual Environment**: Must be recreated after cleanup (not tracked in Git)
- **Dependencies**: All requirements preserved in `requirements.txt`
- **Database**: SQLite file remains functional after renaming
- **Static Files**: All JavaScript and CSS references updated correctly

**Next Critical Step**: The system is now ready for production deployment preparation and comprehensive user testing.
